Features include:
- Accumulating wealth via chatting
- Setting your own profile text
- Earning and choosing a title to display next to your name
- An inventory system which allows any item to be created and given to another user
- An away from keyboard (AFK) system that alerts people that you're away, and a message that you've left if you set one
- Rolling dice for in-server fun and games
